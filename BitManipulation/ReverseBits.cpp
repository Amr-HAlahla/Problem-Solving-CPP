/* Key Idea: You need to go through all 32 bits of the input number:
 *
 * 1- Extract the last bit from the input using (n & 1)
 *  - n & 1 = n & 00000001 = First bit from n.
 * 2- Add it to the reversed number by shifting current result left and OR-ing it
 * 3- Shift n right by 1 to go to the next bit
 * 4- Repeat for all 32 bits
 *
 * Time : O(32) â†’ constant time since it's always 32 bits.
 * Space : O(1).
