# CPP-Practice: Problem Solving with Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of C++ solutions for classic data structures and algorithms problems. The code is organized by topic, making it easy to find and study solutions for a wide range of technical interview and competitive programming questions.

## Directory Structure

- **ArraysAndStrings/**: Problems and solutions related to arrays and strings, including manipulation, searching, and pattern matching.
- **BinarySearch/**: Binary search and its applications on arrays and matrices.
- **Hashing/**: Problems utilizing hash tables for efficient lookups and frequency counting.
- **LinkedList/**: Classic linked list operations, including reversal, merging, and cycle detection.
- **Pointers/**: Two-pointer and multiple-pointer techniques for array and string problems.
- **Queues/**: Queue implementations and problems, including circular queues and queue using stacks.
- **SlidingWindow/**: Sliding window techniques for subarray and substring problems.
- **Stacks/**: Stack-based problems, including next greater/smaller elements, parentheses validation, and custom stack implementations.
- **Trees/**: Binary tree and binary search tree problems, including traversals, balancing, and path sums.

## How to Use

- Each folder contains C++ source files (`.cpp`) for individual problems.
- Open any `.cpp` file to view the solution and main function for testing.
- You can compile and run any file using a C++ compiler, for example:
  ```sh
  g++ ArraysAndStrings/TwoSum.cpp -o TwoSum.exe
  ./TwoSum.exe
  ```
